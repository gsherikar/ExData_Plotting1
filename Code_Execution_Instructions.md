## How to run and test the four .R files (plot1.R...plot4.R) 

<ol>
<li>Clone this repository to your local machine</li>
<li>In the repo directory, you should see a sub-directory or folder called exdata_data_household_power_consumption </li>
<li>Copy/extract the supplied data file household_power_consumption.txt to exdata_data_household_power_consumption folder or subdirectory</li>
<li>First execute plot1.R</li>
<li>plot1.R saves the subset data in a new separate file called household_power_consumption_subset.txt. This subset data file will be used by subsequent R code. This is just to avoid reading the big sized file for each run. That said, if you wish to still test each code against the original data file, then simply remove the household_power_consumption_subset.txt file after each execution</li>
<li>Now run plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R</li>
</ol>

## Thankyou!
