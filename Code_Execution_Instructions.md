## How to run and test the four .R files (plot1.R...plot4.R) 

<ol>
<li>Clone this repository to your local machine</li>
<li>In the repo directory, you should see a sub-directory or folder called exdata_data_household_power_consumption </li>
<li>Copy/extract the supplied data file household_power_consumption to exdata_data_household_power_consumption folder or subdirectory</li>
<li>First execute plot1.R</li>
<li>plot1.R saves the subset data in a new separate file called household_power_consumption_subset.txt. This subset data file will be used by subsequent R code</li>
<li>Now run plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R</li>
</ol>

## Thankyou!
